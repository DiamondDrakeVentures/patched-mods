# Patched Mods

Some mods are optimistic about their dependency version requirements.
They may run just fine with older versions.

The mods are configured in [`config.json`](config.json).
They are patched by a GitHub Actions workflow using [PatchVer](https://github.com/diamonddrakeventures/patchver).
